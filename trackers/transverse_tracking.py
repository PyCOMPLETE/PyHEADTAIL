    all the segment boundaries. The TransverseMap stores all the
    relevant parameters (optics) at each segment boundary. The first
    boundary of the first segment is referred to as the injection
    point.

    parameters needed to generate the TransverseSegmentMaps. It is not
    capable of tracking particles. The transport mechanism of particles
    in the transverse plane is entirely implemented in the
