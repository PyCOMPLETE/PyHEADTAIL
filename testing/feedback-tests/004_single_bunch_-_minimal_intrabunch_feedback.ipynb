    "## Minimal feedback model\n",
    "The minimal feedback model includes the main elements of the feedback system, which might limit performance. Items for this model have chosen such a way that the modeled system should, in principle,  be possible to be built in real-life and any element of the model cause minimal disturbances and artifacts to simulation results. It is worth noting that the performance of the feedback system depends strongly on the details of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following signal processors have been chosen to the minimal model:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Bypass(...)** - for monitoring the input signal\n",
    " \n",
    " * **ChargeWeighter(...)** - it was found that the charge weighted signal (i.e. 𝛥-signal from the pickup plate) is more stable in the simulations than the pure displacement signal (i.e. 𝛥/𝛴-signal from the pickup plates). This is because the stronger oscillations on the head/tail of the bunch together with the limited bandwidth might cause artificially strong kicks to the main, center, part of the bunch leading to instability growth if the \"𝛥/𝛴-signal\" is used. Note that the weighting is normalized to be one to the maximum charge, i.e. damping on the head/tail is reduced.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **Noise(...)** - Often it is argued that the pickup noise is the main noise source. In that case, noise must be added before the bandwidth limitation, which is often set by the used power amplifier and/or the kicker structure\n",
    " \n",
    " * **Gaussian(...)** - There are many ways to limit bandwidth, but a Gaussian filter is chosen for the minimal model.  The reasons for that are that, in principle, the frequency responses of the real systems can often be modified into Gaussian shape and a Gaussian filter is straightforward to the treat both in a time domain and in a frequency domain. It is worth noting that simulations results depend strongly on the chosen model for the bandwidth limitation. It is also important to keep in mind that the impulse response of the filter must be smooth in order to get reasonable results, e.g. the sharp peaks in the impulse responses of an RC filter and a phase linearized low pass filter cause of unrealistically good damping if a second cutoff frequency (smoothing) is not set correctly.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **TurnDelay(...)** - One turn delay between the pickup readings and the correction kicks can be implemented by using a *TurnDelay(...)*. The default correction algorithm is based on vector sum, which works well and can be also implemented in real systems. The correction algorithm type can be chosen the *combiner* parameter or giving FIR filter coefficients manually using a *TurnFIRFilter*-object."
